    <div class="faq">
      <p><b>Is an original piece of your work?</b></p>
      <p>
        Indeed, every print I offer is an original work. They are exclusively
        photographs I have captured personally.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p
        ><b
          >Do you provide the option for digital downloads so I can print the
          image on my own?</b
        ></p
      >
      <p>
        Certainly, all prints featured on my website have an option for digital
        download. This allows you the flexibility to print the image yourself.
        The provided file is a high-resolution jpeg, enabling you to produce
        prints in all the sizes listed on my website.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p><b>How would you describe the quality of your prints?</b></p>

      <p>
        I ensure all my prints maintain a consistent, high-quality standard.
        They are produced on museum-grade, Fine Art 310GSM, archival cotton rag
        paper. With a matte finish and a delightful texture, these 310GSM prints
        are thick and the quality is instantly apparent.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p><b>What are the exact dimensions of your prints?</b></p>

      <p>
        Here are the precise dimensions of the prints in mm: 400mm x 600mm,
        600mm x 900mm, and 800mm x 1200mm.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p><b>Do your prints come with white borders?</b></p>

      <p>
        Indeed, all of my prints feature a white border surrounding the image.
        The size of this border depends on the print size and whether or not the
        print is framed. Unframed prints generally have a 15mm white border.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p><b>How do you package your prints?</b></p>
      <p
        >Prints are either packaged in a tube or flat packed depending on the
        size of the print. Only dense protective tubes or strong flat pack
        materials are used to ensure the safety and security whilst shipping.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p><b>Do you offer prints with frames?</b></p>
      <p
        >Yes, framed prints are available. The options include: 400mm x 600mm,
        600mm x 900mm, and 800mm x 1200mm, all with varying frame profiles.
        Prints are dry mounted to an acid-free 5mm foam board using an archival
        adhesive film. Each print is housed in a handcrafted shadow box frame
        made from FSC certified Victorian Ash and fronted with durable 3mm
        museum-grade plexiglass. The frame is available in a natural, black, or
        white finish.</p
      >
      <br />
      <p><b>How are your framed prints packaged?</b></p>

      <p
        >Framed prints are securely packed using Polycell EcoPure biodegradable
        bubble wrap and cartons made of 77% recycled content and 33% FSC
        certified kraft fibres.</p
      >

      <br />

      <p><b>What are the shipping charges?</b></p>
      <p
        >For Australia, both unframed and framed prints are shipped for free.
        International customers purchasing unframed prints are charged a
        standard flat fee of $50. For international shipping of framed prints,
        please reach out for a custom quote specific to your location.</p
      >
      <br />

      <p
        ><b
          >If I purchase a single print or two, how can I have it framed
          elsewhere?</b
        ></p
      >
      <p
        >Having your prints framed is a simple process. You can locate a framing
        service in your locality with a quick Google search. Consider their
        reviews and choose one that suits your needs. They will assist you in
        selecting your frame and border options and will typically handle the
        entire process, including delivery and hanging, if required.</p
      >
      <br />

      <p><b>Do you conduct private photography sessions?</b></p>
      <p>Yes. Feel free to send me a message</p>
      <br />

      <p
        ><b
          >I represent a brand and would like to book you for a private
          shoot.</b
        ></p
      >
      <p
        >Of course, simply send me a message and we can initiate the process.</p
      >
      <br />
      <p><b>Can I schedule a private shoot?</b></p>
      <p
        >Yes, you certainly can! Just send me a message and we can plan an
        exceptional photo shoot just for you!</p
